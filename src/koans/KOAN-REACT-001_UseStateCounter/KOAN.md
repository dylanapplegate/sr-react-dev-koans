# The Way of useState: Simple Counter

> "Before useState, there was nothing. After useState, there is state." - React Zen Master

## Concept Overview

In React's functional components, the `useState` Hook provides a way to add state without converting to a class component. This koan challenges you to implement a simple counter using the `useState` Hook.

## Your Task

Create a Counter component that:

1. Uses the `useState` Hook to track a count value
2. Displays the current count
3. Provides buttons to increment and decrement the counter
4. Ensures the count never goes below zero

## Requirements

- Implement the Counter in the `index.tsx` file
- Use only functional components and Hooks
- Style your component using Tailwind CSS classes
- Make sure all tests pass

May your state be ever immutable, and your renders pure.

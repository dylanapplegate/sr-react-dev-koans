# React Koans: Senior Frontend Engineer Topics Checklist

This document outlines the comprehensive set of topics and concepts that "React Koans" aims to cover, designed to refresh and solidify knowledge for a senior React frontend engineering role. This checklist serves as a guide for generating individual koans and ensuring broad coverage.

## 1. React Core Concepts (Modern Hooks Focus)

- `useState` (state management, immutability)
- `useEffect` (side effects, cleanup, dependency array)
- `useContext` (global state management)
- `useRef` (DOM interaction, mutable values)
- `useCallback` & `useMemo` (performance optimization, memoization)
- Component Lifecycle (how hooks map to lifecycle)
- Props & State (data flow, PropTypes/TypeScript type checking)
- Conditional Rendering
- List Rendering & Keys
- Event Handling
- Error Boundaries
- Portals
- Fragments
- HOCs vs. Render Props vs. Custom Hooks (understanding patterns)

## 2. Advanced React Patterns & Performance

- Custom Hooks (building reusable logic)
- Context API vs. External State Management (e.g., Redux Toolkit, Zustand - conceptual understanding)
- `React.memo` / `PureComponent`
- Code Splitting (`React.lazy`, `Suspense`)
- Optimizing re-renders
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / Static Site Generation (SSG) - conceptual understanding, Next.js basics (optional)

## 3. JavaScript & TypeScript Proficiency

- **TypeScript:**
  - Basic types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `array`, `object`)
  - Interfaces vs. Types
  - Generics
  - Utility Types (`Partial`, `Omit`, `Pick`, `Record`)
  - Type Guards
  - Working with React Props in TS
  - Typing Custom Hooks
- **Modern JavaScript (ES6+):**
  - Destructuring, Spread/Rest Operators
  - Async/Await, Promises
  - Modules (import/export)
  - `Map`, `Set`, `WeakMap`, `WeakSet`
  - Closures
  - `this` context
  - Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.)

## 4. Web Fundamentals & UX Considerations

- **HTML5 & CSS3:**
  - Semantic HTML (importance for accessibility)
  - CSS Box Model, Flexbox, Grid
  - Responsive Design (media queries, `srcset`, `picture` element)
  - CSS-in-JS (conceptual understanding vs. Tailwind)
- **Accessibility (A11y):**
  - WCAG principles (conceptual)
  - ARIA attributes (roles, states, properties)
  - Keyboard navigation (focus management)
  - Form accessibility
  - Color contrast
- **Internationalization (i18n):**
  - Basic concepts (translation, pluralization)
  - Date/time formatting
- **Adaptive UI & Responsive Design:**
  - Breakpoints
  - Fluid layouts
  - Cross-browser compatibility

## 5. Design Systems & Component Libraries

- Principles of Design Systems
- Building Reusable & Composable UI Components
- Storybook (component documentation & development environment)
- Figma (understanding designer handoff, component spec)

## 6. Testing

- **Unit Testing:**
  - Jest (basics, mocking)
  - React Testing Library (querying, events, assertions)
  - Testing Hooks
  - Testing async operations
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Testing component interactions
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** (Conceptual understanding, Cypress/Playwright basics - optional)
- Test Driven Development (TDD) - conceptual understanding

## 7. Tooling & Ecosystem

- **Build Tools:** (Vite/Webpack - conceptual understanding of bundling, transpilation)
- **Linters & Formatters:** (ESLint, Prettier - importance of consistent code style)
- **Package Managers:** (npm, yarn, pnpm)
- **Version Control:** (Git workflows - branching, merging, rebasing, pull requests)
- **Browser Developer Tools:** (Performance, Network, Elements, Console)

## 8. Architecture & Best Practices

- Folder Structure & Project Organization
- Code Review Process & Best Practices
- Secure Coding Practices (basic web security, XSS, CSRF)
- Performance Optimization Strategies (loading, rendering, network)
- Refactoring Techniques
- Scalability & Maintainability
- Cross-Team Collaboration (understanding product, design, backend interactions)
- API Integration (RESTful APIs, data fetching patterns)
- Basic AWS Management (S3, CloudFront, Lambda - as per job description, conceptual)
- Observability and Monitoring (conceptual)
